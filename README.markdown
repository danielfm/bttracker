# BtTracker

BtTracker is a BitTorrent UDP-based tracker written in C for learning purposes.

## Supported Platforms

This code is known to compile and run on the following platforms:

* Linux
* Mac OS X 10.8 (with [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/))

### Current Status

At this point, BtTracker is only capable of receiving incoming connection
requests; support for announces and scrapes are not yet implemented.

## Building

First, make sure to install the following software:

* GCC, or a C-99 compiler
* [GLib](https://developer.gnome.org/glib/) 2.36.0+
* [Automake](http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/)
* [Autoconf](http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/â€Ž)

Assuming that you've already cloned the repository, open a terminal and run the
following commands in its root directory:

````bash

$ autoreconf -iv
$ ./configure
$ make
````

If you have trouble compiling this on your platform, please send us a pull
request.

## Running

If you have successfully compiled the code, you can now run the program:

````bash

$ src/bttracker
````

At this point, the program will wait for UDP datagrams on port `1234`.

This is how a session looks like:

complete.
