# BtTracker

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/danielfm/bttracker.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/danielfm/bttracker)

BtTracker is a Redis-backed UDP-based BitTorrent tracker written in C for
learning purposes.

## Supported Platforms

This code is known to compile and run on Linux (tested on ArchLinux and Ubuntu).

### Features

* Stores data on Redis (convenience and performance :-)
* Configurable via .cfg file
* Syslog integration with detailed logging (debug mode)

### Current Status

At this point, BtTracker is only capable of receiving incoming connection
requests and responding to announces; support for scrapes are not yet
implemented (hopefully it will be soon enough).

## Building

First, make sure you have the required toolchain in order to compile it:

* [GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org/), or a C-99 compiler
* [pkg-config](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/)
* [Automake](http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/)
* [Autoconf](http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/â€Ž)

Also, you need to install the required software/libraries:

* [GLib](https://developer.gnome.org/glib/)
* [Redis](http://redis.io/) and [Hiredis](https://github.com/redis/hiredis/)

Assuming that you've already cloned the repository, open a terminal and run the
following commands in its root directory:

````bash

$ autoreconf -iv
$ ./configure
$ make
````

In order to run the unit tests:

````bash

$ make test
````

The tests are minimal since I still didn't settle for a macro design just yet,
but the tests will eventually be written.

If you have failing tests, please send us a pull request.

## Running

If you have successfully compiled the code, you can now run the program:

````bash

$ src/bttracker <config_file>
````

A default configuration, `bttracker.conf` file can be found at the project
root directory.

## Installing

I don't recommend you to `make install` this package because it is not yet
complete.
